CubeSatDSE is a tool to support the automation of managing variability & interdependencies of Cyber Physical System (i.e. CubeSat system) with configuring & optimizing component parameters.

CubeSatDSE makes use of Architecture Design Space Graph (ADSG) and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) methods, with a link by Class Factory Evaluator (CFE).

The tool comprises of 4 code scripts:
1. _CFE2025Version_ is for running the complete automation scenario of ADSG-MDO
2. _Components_for_CFE_ is MDO classes of CubeSat components to run by (1)
3. _MDOWrapper2025Version_ is for running standalone MDO scenario
4. _MDO_Components_ is MDO classes of CubeSat components to run by (3)
